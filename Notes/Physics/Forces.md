Notes:
## [[Force]]

A [[force]] is a push or a pull and is measured in newtons.

üí° One of Newton's laws of physics: $F=ma$


## Balanced Force

Balanced forces are [[Forces]] that act on an object but **cancels** each other out because they are the **same size** and are acting **opposite directions**. Resulting in **no [[net force]]** on the object.

## Unbalanced Force

If the [[Forces]] acting on an object are in **opposite directions** and **different sizes** then it is **unbalanced**.

## Pressure

[[Pressure]] is the amount of **[[force]]** applied at the right angle to the **surface** of an object per unit **area**.

üìê $P=F/A$


pressure = force / area

## [[Mass]] and [[Weight]]

[[**Mass**]] is the measure of the **amount of [[matter]]** in an object.

**[[Weight]]** is the measure of the **[[force]]** on an object caused by the effect of **[[gravity]]**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **The mass of an object does not change but weight change due to [[gravity]].**


## [[Acceleration]]

[[Acceleration]] Occurs when:

-   [[Force]] is applied to a stationary object: $Fnet=ma$
-   [[Force]] is applied an object at travelling at constant [[speed]]: $Fnet=ma$
