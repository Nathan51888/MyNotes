	- Used to preserve meats historically due to its high pathogen content.
- Better done on thin slices of food for both smoke curing and salt curing.
	- By doing an Accordion cut against the grain to get longer pieces which are easier to drape over the fire.
- Not very effective as salt curing is.
	- Salt helps with drying quickly which chemically kills microbes and helps stopping them from growing.
	- Safe smoking usually starts with a salt cure.
- Smoking at a temperature below 30C allows the moisture deep inside the meat travel out since the outer layer aren't fully sealed.
- Woods used for smoking must be fully dry on the inside in order to burn effectively and not fizzle out due to the water content.
	- Tree branches that are found laying on the ground are dead branches that had been dead and completely dried out on the tree before dropping to the ground.
- Smoked meats looks pink on the inside around the outer layer even when cooked.

- Fruits can be salt cured just like a piece of meat.
	- The acidity of fruits makes it less hospitable to microorganisms.
