### **Resistance to Change** - why do people not want to change?
Â According to Kotter and Schlesinger (1979), there are **four reasons that certain people are resisting change:**
-  **Self-interest** (concerned with the implication of the change to themselves and their own interests, rather than the success of the business)
-  **Misunderstanding** (communication problems; inadequate information)
- **Low tolerance to change** (wants security and stability in their work)
- **Different assessments of the situation** (employees may disagree on the reasons for the change and on the advantages and disadvantages of the change process)

### Models of Change - How do leaders create change?
Here are four model to prevent, decrease or minimize resistance to change in organizations.
1. **Education and Communication** - Educating people about the change effort beforehand comes in top priority to overcome resistance to change. Up front communication and education helps employees see the logic behind the change effort and reduces unfounded and incorrect rumours concerning the effects of change in the organization.

3. **Participation and Involvement** - When employees are involved in the change effort they are more likely to buy into change rather than resist it.
4. **Negotiation and Agreement** - In case where employees resisting change are in a position of power it's best to combat resistance by offering incentives to not resist change. This can be done by allowing veto of elements of change that are threatening, or offering incentives to leave the company through early buyouts or retirements in order to avoid having to experience the change effort.
5. **Coercion** - Where speed is essential and to be used only as last resort. Managers can force employees into accepting change by making clear that resisting changing can lead to losing jobs, firing, transferring or not promoting employees.
