# Quality Control
This method checks the quality of **completed products** for faults. **Quality inspectors** measure or test every product, samples from each batch, or random samples - as appropriate to the kind of product produced.

###### **Advantages** 
- Inspection is intended to prevent faulty products reaching the customer. This approach means having specially trained inspectors, rather than every individual being responsible for his or her own work. 

###### **Disadvantages**
-   **Rejected product is expensive** for a firm as it has incurred the **full costs of production** but cannot be sold as the manufacturer does not want its name associated with substandard product. Some rejected product can be re-worked, but in many industries it has to be scrapped – either way **rejects incur more costs**. 
-   A quality control approach can be highly effective at **preventing defective products** from reaching the customer. However, if **defect levels are very high**, the company’s **profitability will suffer** unless steps are taken to tackle the root causes of the failures.
-   **Individuals** are **not** necessarily **encouraged to take responsibility for the quality** of their own work. Giving workers **responsibility** for their own work helps to **improve motivation** by **increasing the interest and variety** in the job, so [[Quality Assurance]] tends to be preferred for this reason as well.
