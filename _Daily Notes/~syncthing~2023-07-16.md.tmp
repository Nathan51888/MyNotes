Morning Brain Dump:
Had a dream last night about running away from a man eating monster at a restaurant with my family driving a car with me sitting at the back on a trailer on top of a tall stack of books and other stuff. The monster was small and skinny at first and stared at me for a while before it went in as I was eating and heard screams filled the sky. The building was about 3 to 5 sorties tall and when it reached to the top floor, it started playing pool. I was too scared to keep eating and told my family to pack up as I scramble my way up to a pile of stuff on the trailer at the back of the car. As we were driving out of there having needed to go in a circle panicked I was, the monster noticed the stack of books that I was sitting on and looked interested about them.
