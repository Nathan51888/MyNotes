Notes:

## Speed

Speed is a measure of how **far** an object can travel in a given **amount** **of** **time**.

 📐 $v=d/t$


speed = change in distance / change in time

## Acceleration

Acceleration is the **rate** at witch an object **changes** its **speed**.

📐 $a=v/t$


acceleration = change in velocity / change in time`
