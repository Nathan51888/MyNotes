### Balanced Force

Balanced forces are [[Forces]] that act on an object but **cancels** each other out because they are the **same size** and are acting **opposite directions**. Resulting in no [[Net force]] on the object.

### Unbalanced Force

If the [[Forces]] acting on an object are in **opposite directions** and **different sizes** then it is **unbalanced**.
