# [[Conceptual Notes]]

## Taking Notes
- Try to actively listen to the material and separate them into concepts 
- Not *indivisual information* such as:
> **U**n-important
> **S**elf Explanatory
> **E**asy to Remember
- Engages in *Active Learning*
- Questions arrises in real time

---

## Old Notes
- Serves as a foundation of all future [[Learning]].
- Encourages **[[First Principles Thinking]]**
- No more re-taking notes on the things you forgot
- Old notes will *grow over time*

---

## Linking
- Prevents limiting your thinking based on "disciplines"
- Encourages **invention**, rather than *regurgitation*
- Inspires new ideas by having a unique connection
- Your notes are linked in a way that make sense to *you*

---

## Fluidity
- Your knowledge is constantly *changing*, but your sequential notes will always stay the same
- You can edit with ease with conceptual notes
