[[Caffeine]] does affect athletic performance by improving stamina in prolonged moderate intensity exercise and more explosive movements in high intensity exercise.

[[Caffeine]] blocks out [[Adenosine]] from binding with the [[Adenosine Receptors]] on the [[Axon]] of the [[Neuron]] by binding with it itself.

Caffeine affects the activation of the muscles by increasing the amount of calcium released.

Caffeine also suppresses your sense of pain.

Average dose of caffeine to achieve these benefits is 2-3 mg per kg body mass.
