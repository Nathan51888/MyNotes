## [[Force]]

A [[Force]] is a push or a pull and is measured in newtons.

> üí° One of Newton's [[Laws of Physics]]: $F=ma$

### Balanced Force

Balanced forces are [[Forces]] that act on an object but **cancels** each other out because they are the **same size** and are acting **opposite directions**. Resulting in **no [[Net force]]** on the object.

### Unbalanced Force

If the [[Forces]] acting on an object are in **opposite directions** and **different sizes** then it is **unbalanced**.

## [[Pressure]]

[[Pressure]] is the amount of **[[Force]]** applied at the right angle to the **surface** of an object per unit **area**.

> üìê $P=F/A$
> pressure = force / area


## [[Mass]] and [[Weight]]

[[Mass]] is the measure of the **amount of [[Matter]]** in an object.

**[[Weight]]** is the measure of the **[[Force]]** on an object caused by the effect of **[[Gravity]]**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **The mass of an object does not change but weight change due to [[Gravity]].**


## [[Acceleration]]

[[Acceleration]] occurs when:
-   [[Force]] is applied to a stationary object: $Fnet=ma$
-   [[Force]] is applied an object at travelling at constant [[Speed]]: $Fnet=ma$
