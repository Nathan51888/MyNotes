# Kaizen
 A system of **continuous improvement** in quality, technology, processes, company culture, productivity, safety and leadership.

##### Advantages
- More employee empowerment, moral and job satisfaction
- Faster changes
- Easier and cheaper to implement
- Less likely to be resisted

Kaizen is a system that **involves every employee** - from upper management to the cleaning crew. Everyone is encouraged to come up with **small improvement** suggestions on a **regular basis**. This is not a once a month or once a year activity. It is continuous. Japanese companies, such as Toyota and Canon, a total of 60 to 70 suggestions per employee per year are written down, shared and implemented.

In most cases these are not ideas for major changes. Kaizen is based on making little changes on a regular basis: **always improving productivity, safety and effectiveness while reducing waste**.

With every employee looking for ways to make improvements, you can expect results such as:

1.  **Kaizen Reduces Waste** in areas such as inventory, transportation, worker motion, employee skills, over production, excess quality and in processes.  

3.  **Kaizen Improves** space utilization, product quality, use of capital, communications, production capacity and employee retention. 
4.  **Kaizen Provides** immediate results. Instead of focusing on large, capital intensive improvements, Kaizen focuses on creative investments that continually solve large numbers of small problems. Large, capital projects and major changes will still be needed, and Kaizen will also improve the capital projects process, but the real power of Kaizen is in the on-going process of continually making small improvements that improve processes and reduce waste.
