# Total Quality Management
**Total quality management (TQM)** is the continual process of detecting and reducing or eliminating errors in manufacturing, streamlining supply chain management, improving the customer experience, and ensuring that employees are up to speed with training.

>**TQM** views "quality" entirely from the point of view of "**the customer**".

**Internal and External Customers**
A business's **internal customer** is someone like a production employee working at the end of the production line, being the customer of the employees involved in the earlier production process.
An **external customer** is the average people who purchases the end product.

> TQM recognises that all businesses require "processes" that enable customer requirements to be met. TQM focuses on the ways in which these processes can be managed - with two key objectives:

> 1.  **100% customer satisfaction**

> 3.  **Zero defects**

##### Advantages
- Less wastage of materials and more profitability
- More customer loyalty

##### Drawbacks
- Initial costs of implementing TQM
- Staff may command higher pay, increasing cost of wages
- Managers may not feel confident
- Quality may not be the priority of the business

#### **The Importance of Customer - Supplier Relationships** 
"**Quality Chains**" - TQM focuses strongly on the importance of the **relationship** between **customers (internal and external) and supplier**. These are known as the "**quality chains**” and they can be broken at any point by one person or one piece of equipment not meeting the requirements of the customer.

Failure to meet the requirements in any part of a quality chain has a way of multiplying, and failure in one part of the system creates problems elsewhere, leading to yet more failure and problems, and so the situation is exacerbated. - The ability to meet customers’ (external and internal) requirements is vital.

#### **Introducing TQM into a Business**
-   For example, it requires that management give employees a say in the production processes that they are involved in. In a culture of **continuous improvement**, workforce views are invaluable. The problem is - many businesses have barriers to involvement. For example, middle managers may feel that their authority is being challenged.

-   So "**empowerment**" is a crucial part of TQM. The key to success is to identify the management culture before attempting to install TQM and to take steps to change towards the management style required for it. 
-   This May require a **change in business culture** - Since culture is not the first thing that managers think about, this step has often been missed or ignored with resultant failure of a TQM strategy.
-   TQM also focuses the business on the **activities** of the business that are **closest to the customer** - e.g. the production department, the employees facing the customer. This can cause resentment amongst departments that previously considered themselves "above" the shop floor
