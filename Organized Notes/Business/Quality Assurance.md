# Quality Assurance
This is an approach that aims to achieve quality by organising every process to get the product ‘**right first time**’ and prevent mistakes ever happening. This is also known as a ‘**zero defect**’ approach.

In quality assurance, there is more emphasis on ‘**self-checking**’, rather than checking by inspectors. 

###### **Advantages**
-   **Costs are reduced** because there is **less wastage** and **re-working of faulty products** as the product is **checked at every stage**. 
-   It can help **improve worker motivation** as workers have more ownership and recognition for their work (see Herzberg). 
-   It can help break down ‘us and them’ barriers between workers and managers as it eliminates the feeling of being checked up on. 
-   With all staff responsible for quality, this can help the firm gain marketing advantages arising from its consistent level of quality.
