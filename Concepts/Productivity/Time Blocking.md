# Time Blocking
A visual representation of what's happening in a day

### The priority system:
1. Appointments(least flexible, most important) - Scheduled appointments or events that if rescheduled cause the other person a lot of trouble.
2. Bottleneck(less flexible, important for progress) - things that prevent you from progressing and roll over to the next day if left incomplete.
3. Critical(flexible, important) - things that won't roll over but still important for my progress
4. Daily routine - daily routines that if missed won't cause too much problem
5. Dream self - things that I wish my best self would do in a day
