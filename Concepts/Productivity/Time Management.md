# Time Management
A way to plan out the [[time]] of tasks and events on a given date.

To efficiently manage my tasks I will need to use a [[Task Management]] app.
For grander events and appointments I will use a [[Time Blocking]] calendar.
For managing tasks within a project that I'm working on I will need to use a [[Project Management]] app.

**[[Task Management]]**:
TickTick
Microsoft Todo

**[[Time Blocking]]**:
Google calendar
Cron
Plan

**[[Project Management]]**:
Trello

**Features that I'm looking for in an app**
Multi device support(Windows, Android)

**Distinctions to make**:
Time blocking is **not task management**, it's only a rough preview of the day
Task management should be easy to access and change tasks
Project management handles the **status** of the tasks within a project and rarely the **timing** of it.
