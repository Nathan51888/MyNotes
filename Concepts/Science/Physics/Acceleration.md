# Acceleration $a$

Acceleration is the rate at witch an object changes its [[Speed]].

> [!equation]
> $a=v/t$
> Acceleration = *change in* [[Velocity]] / *change in* [[Time]]

[[Acceleration]] occurs when:
-   [[Force]] is applied to a stationary object: $Fnet=ma$
-   [[Force]] is applied an object at travelling at constant [[Speed]]: $Fnet=ma$
